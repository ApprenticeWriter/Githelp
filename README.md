Projecty stuff
I have no idea how readmes work but this is a homework project
hopefully this will help us understand github

....mistakes were made.

1. We need to figure out if it's possible to merge two files into one? (like the case with css.css and styles.css
2. Set up website so it is available online. (githelp.github.io?)
3. What kind of functionality do we want to add to the website?
4. Log every little error or issue you run into! We must have something to write about :)
